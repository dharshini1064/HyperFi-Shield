        Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, has taken the financial world by storm,
        offering a paradigm shift from traditional banking systems to a more
        inclusive and transparent financial ecosystem. In this guide, we will
        delve into the dynamic realm of DeFi, focusing on two prominent
        blockchain platforms: Ethereum and Polygon. These networks have become
        hotbeds for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts,
        creating a fertile ground for innovative financial solutions.

        {" "}
        DeFi refers to a set of financial services built on blockchain
        technology, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries such as
        banks. This allows for peer-to-peer transactions, lending, borrowing,
        and trading without centralized control. Ethereum and Polygon are at the
        forefront of this revolution, each contributing unique features to the
        DeFi landscape.

          The Pioneer of Smart Contracts Ethereum, launched in 2015, is the
          pioneer of smart contract functionality. Smart contracts are
          self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly
          written into code. This feature has been the cornerstone of DeFi
          development on Ethereum.
